# Smart Library Management AI System

This project outlines a comprehensive Smart Library Management AI System designed to modernize library operations through advanced technology and artificial intelligence.

## Core Features:

-   **Advanced AI for Book Management:** Implement AI algorithms for intelligent book categorization, recommendation systems based on user behavior, demand forecasting for new acquisitions, and optimized shelf placement. This includes features like automated metadata extraction and cataloging.
-   **Web Application for User Tracking:** A user-friendly web portal allowing users to search the catalog, view their borrowing history, reserve books, and receive personalized recommendations. This application will track user activity and preferences to improve the AI's effectiveness.
-   **Admin Dashboards:** Powerful dashboards for library administrators to gain insights into library usage, popular books, user demographics, and operational efficiency. These dashboards will visualize data collected by the system to support informed decision-making.
-   **Staff Attendance Tracking:** A module for tracking staff attendance, managing schedules, and monitoring workload. This can be integrated with facial recognition or RFID systems for automated check-in/check-out.
-   **Book Return Monitoring:** An automated system for monitoring book returns, managing overdue books, and generating reminders for users. This can include features like self-return kiosks and automated fine calculation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to set up a development environment and install the necessary dependencies.

Previews of the web application should run automatically when starting a workspace with the configured environment.

Further details on setting up and running the different components of the system will be provided in subsequent documentation.

This system is based on a Flask web application starter template, utilizing best practices as outlined in the Flask documentation ([https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/quickstart/#a-minimal-application](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/quickstart/#a-minimal-application)).
